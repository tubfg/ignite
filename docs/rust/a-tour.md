# [A tour of Rust](https://tourofrust.com/)

The idea of this is to get an overview of the features of Rust so that I have a general idea of what's happening when I jump into more complicated tutorials and projects. I'm excited to learn this language and start building cool and useful programs with it!

## Doubt
I'm learning JS right now. Learning the syntax and the usage of another language, especially something as complex as Rust, doesn't seem right. Its an overload of the same kind of information. I need to build things to learn a concept.  
The Tour of Rust is good but Rust by Example (RBE) has the same kind of information. I think I should go through this without making too many notes and then do the related topics on RBE.
