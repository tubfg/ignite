# Rust üõ©Ô∏è
A new low-level language with an awesome community that makes programming more joyful.

I chose this because I think it has a wide scope.
Low-level software, embedded systems, front-end and back-end of web apps. 
Simplicity is good.
The idea is to learn just a few languages but learn them very well so I can do many things on a computer :)

## Learning
* There are a lot of ways to learn Rust. Start here [A tour](https://tourofrust.com/TOC_en.html), then this if required 
[By example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/index.html), then a nice big one [cookbook](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-cookbook/) and finally, [a comparison with C](http://cliffle.com/p/dangerust/). 
Then have a look at max-2-max 5 articles / videos / posts 
from that Medium article ([this one](https://towardsdatascience.com/you-want-to-learn-rust-but-you-dont-know-where-to-start-fc826402d5ba)). There's also a [article about mental model for Rust](https://kerkour.com/rust-mental-models)
* Learning is good but how about using it? A compression program. A program for anonymous credentials. 
A browser [engine](https://limpet.net/mbrubeck/2014/08/08/toy-layout-engine-1.html). 
A web [application](https://joelmccracken.github.io/entries/a-simple-web-app-in-rust-pt-1/). 
An encrypted and compressed filesystem. Then open source üòã.
