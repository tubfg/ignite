# Web3
We might move towards a decentralized internet.
Learn how to develop useful things for it.
It would be really interesting to see how people would use software which they control.

## Learn
Start off with this [cool video I found on YouTube](https://youtu.be/l44z35vabvA)
I hear [Solana](https://solana.com/developers) is the fastest growing platform and has potential.
I should learn how it works, what you can build with it, and then build useful products with it ðŸ§¶.
The IPFS platform also looks very good. They have some tutorials at [Protocol schools](https://proto.school/tutorials). 
I want to contribute to its development ðŸ˜„
