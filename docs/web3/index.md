# Web3
We might move towards a decentralized internet.
Learn how to develop useful things for it. The internet kinda sucks the way it's being censored now. 
I like freedom and wish everyone is given the opportunity to do what they want 
(as long as it doesn't hurt anyone). I believe this can be a good starting point for that. 
PRIVACY & CHOICE FTW!

## Learn
Start off with this [cool video I found on YouTube](https://youtu.be/l44z35vabvA)
I hear [Solana](https://solana.com/developers) is the fastest growing platform and has potential.
I should learn how it works, what you can build with it, and then build useful products with it ðŸ§¶.
The IPFS platform also looks very good. They have some tutorials at [Protocol schools](https://proto.school/tutorials). 
I want to contribute to its development ðŸ˜„
