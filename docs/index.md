# Another one
An attempt at the 100 days of code challenge. Read more [here](https://www.100daysofcode.com/).  

There are supposed to be multiple rounds and days per round. LMAO, lemme complete round 1 first.  

The basic format for each day is:

* What did you do.
* Link to work (if possible).
* Thoughts about work on that day.

## Round 1
What? Why? I keep picking up things, what will I gain from this one?

* Learn web development, bottom up. It's the future, I can build apps that are easy to use and available everywhere. It will help me be a better developer ("full-stack" perhaps?). I can contribute more, free-lance more and in-general open up more doors!
* Learn rust and build projects with it. It's been growing fast and it looks like a lot of orgs are gonna use it for big projects. It's apparently fun to work with and has memory-safety (YAY!). I like computers wanna actually make things with it and contribute to useful projects :)
* Learn how to develop on the decentralized web. The internet kinda sucks the way it's being censored now. I like freedom and wish everyone is given the opportunity to do what they want (as long as it doesn't hurt anyone). I believe this can be a good starting point for that. PRIVACY & CHOICE FTW!  

Uhmm, being a little more specific:
* [Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) certifications. They're practical ðŸ˜„ and useful from what I hear. Order : Responsive web design -> Front end dev with libraries -> JavaScript algorithms & DS -> Back end dev & APIs.
* There are a lot of ways to learn Rust. Start here [A tour](https://tourofrust.com/TOC_en.html), then this if required [By example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/index.html), then a nice big one [cookbook](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-cookbook/) and finally, a [a comparison with C](http://cliffle.com/p/dangerust/). Then have a look at max-2-max 5 articles / videos / posts from that Medium article ([this one](https://towardsdatascience.com/you-want-to-learn-rust-but-you-dont-know-where-to-start-fc826402d5ba)).
* Learning is good but how about using it? A compression program. A program for anonymous credentials. A browser [engine](https://limpet.net/mbrubeck/2014/08/08/toy-layout-engine-1.html). A web [application](https://joelmccracken.github.io/entries/a-simple-web-app-in-rust-pt-1/). An encrypted and compressed filesystem. Then open source ðŸ˜‹.
* A decentralized web would be great! I hear Solana is the fastest growing platform and has potential.
I should learn how it works, what you can build with it and build stuff ðŸ§¶.
The IPFS platform also looks very good. They have some tutorials at [Protocol schools](https://proto.school/tutorials). I want to contribute to its development ðŸ˜„

Let's go! ðŸ¦‹

## [R1 Logs](./r1)
Notes:
* [Responsive web design](./webdev/resp-web-design).
* [JavaScript algorithms and data structures](./webdev/js-dsa).
* [Front End Development with Libraries](./webdev/front-end-lib).


## Extra extra!
I found JS tutorials for more advanced concepts that I feel are important and not covered by freeCodeCamp:
* [Asynchronous programming in JS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Concepts) used by all modern applications.
* [Client side web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs) tells how to use JS for your page. Pre-requisite for JS frameworks (I think).
* [Event Loop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/EventLoop) is how JS is executed in the browser. This seems important to know how JS actually executes.
* [Arrays for binary data](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Typed_arrays) is how you deal with raw data. Sounds fun!  
* [Execution contexts in JS](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/execution-context-how-javascript-works-behind-the-scenes) explains how the browser engine processes your scripts.
While these are good, I need to use them to really learn them. Must figure out apps I can build with JavaScript.
* [An npm crash course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHDhaSSKmB0) since it is used everywhere.
* [UI design for coders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JCUH5daCCE). The apps we make also need to look good ...

Where would you use CSS Grid and where would you use a Flexbox? These might help:
