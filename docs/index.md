# Ignite

## What's this
I want to build clean (simple but poweful software) and good looking things on a computer.
Things that can help people accomplish their goals.
Mainly, it's a way to learn useful skills and make notes for reference.
The notes shouldn't be just copy-paste from courses.
They should contain small pieces of knowledge that was hard to find / has great impact.

## How's this
Through these

* [Design](./design), which can be useful in describing thoughts in a visual manner.
* [Web Development](./webdev), because that's how people will interact with the stuff that's built.
* [Rust](./rust) can be used to design the server side stuff to handle what the website cannot.
* [Web3](./web3) brings up a new way of thinking about computation and.
It could open up ways to do things that weren't possible before.

## Anything else?
Before learning anything, think about why you want to learn it and what is it that you want to know after learning it.

Oh also, building stuff with other people is really important. Try to collaborate with them on open source projects.

Check out [Credits](./credits) to see what external stuff was used to make this site.
