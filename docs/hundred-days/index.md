# A hundred days of code
An attempt at the 100 days of code challenge. Read more about it [here](https://www.100daysofcode.com/).  

The basic format for each day is:
* What did you do.
* Link to work (if possible).
* Thoughts about work on that day.

Let's go! ðŸ¦‹

## [Trial 1](./trial1)
Notes:
* [Responsive web design](./webdev/resp-web-design).
* [JavaScript algorithms and data structures](./webdev/js-dsa).
* [Front End Development with Libraries](./webdev/front-end-lib).

The initial goals I set will take a long time to accomplish. 
I also want to do this challenge https://www.dailyui.co/ to become a better web developer and designer.

Where can you design stuff? [Penpot, which has a YouTube channel too :)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAqS8G72uv9P5HG1IfgnQ9g)
