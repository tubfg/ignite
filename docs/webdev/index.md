# Web Development
Learn web development, bottom up.
It's the future, I can build apps that are easy to use and available everywhere.
It will help me be a better developer.
I can contribute more, freelance more and in general, have more opportunities to build things!

## Topics
Any content that doesn't really fit in one of these links can be found in this page.
* [HTML](./html)
* [CSS](./css)
* [JavaScript](./js)
* [React & Bootstrap](./react-and-bootstrap) - just a summary.

## Extra learn
* [Cool HTML elements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUxkFEYO4bE&list=PL4-IK0AVhVjOquwY5m3R3KFIEYW2sZEl5&index=3)
in [two videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuLBQXERz8Y).
* [Asynchronous programming in JS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Concepts) 
used by all modern applications.
* [Client side web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs) 
tells how to use JS for your page. Pre-requisite for JS frameworks (I think).
* [Event Loop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/EventLoop) 
is how JS is executed in the browser. This seems important to know how JS actually executes.
* [Arrays for binary data](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Typed_arrays) 
is how you deal with raw data. Sounds fun!  
* [Execution contexts in JS](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/execution-context-how-javascript-works-behind-the-scenes) 
explains how the browser engine processes your scripts.
While these are good, I need to use them to really learn them. Must figure out apps I can build with JavaScript.
