# Web Development
Learn web development, bottom up.
It's the future, I can build apps that are easy to use and available everywhere.
It will help me be a better developer ("full-stack" perhaps?).
I can contribute more, freelance more and in general, have more opportunities to build things!

## Learn
Do [Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) certifications. 
They're practical ðŸ˜„ and useful from what I hear (it's true!).
Maybe I should do all of them ...

## Topics
* [Responsive Web Design](./resp-web-design)
* [JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms](./js-dsa)
* [Front End Libraries](./front-end-lib)

## Extra learn
* [Asynchronous programming in JS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Concepts) 
used by all modern applications.
* [Client side web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs) 
tells how to use JS for your page. Pre-requisite for JS frameworks (I think).
* [Event Loop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/EventLoop) 
is how JS is executed in the browser. This seems important to know how JS actually executes.
* [Arrays for binary data](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Typed_arrays) 
is how you deal with raw data. Sounds fun!  
* [Execution contexts in JS](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/execution-context-how-javascript-works-behind-the-scenes) 
explains how the browser engine processes your scripts.
While these are good, I need to use them to really learn them. Must figure out apps I can build with JavaScript.
* [An npm crash course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHDhaSSKmB0) since it is used everywhere.
* [UI design for coders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JCUH5daCCE). The apps we make also need to look good ...

Where would you use CSS Grid and where would you use a Flexbox? These might help:
